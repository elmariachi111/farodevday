This is the demo code for my talk "how to survive the first weeks as a developer in a fast growing startup": https://www.slideshare.net/stadolf/how-to-survive-the-first-weeks-as-a-developer-in-a-fast-growing-startup 
(live version here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pi63uRSFens&feature=youtu.be&t=30052)

Except the codeception demo that's best ran on local hardware everything can (and should!) be run using Docker. You'll want to install 
Docker on your local machine and make sure that you can invoke `docker` and `docker-compose` on your cli. Note that I wrote and tested 
everthing only on a Mac - the profiling samples might need some manual intervention when ran on a Linux host. If you're on Windows:
install an appropriate operating system first. It's free, it's better and it's much faster and makes you more productive.

Good luck!
